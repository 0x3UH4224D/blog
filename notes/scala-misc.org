#+TITLE: Misc findings about Scala

* Type Classes
  If you declare an instance in the same file where you use it, you have to do
  it *above* the usage, otherwise the implicit resolver will be confused.

* sbt
  - sbt sucks, but it’s the best we got
  - use sbt-revolver’s =re-start=, =re-stop=
  - holy crap, =~= will reload everything on source code change
