* RSS-feed
** One item per post
** One feed per tag
** Optional: One item per post update
   How should that be done? Two ideas:
   1) filter out the git commits that change posts
      - might be problematic because minor updates
   2) create updates to articles manually, save them in some format
      - maybe diffs?
      - maybe another git repo?
** For link collections one item per update
** Content template for RSS updates

* Posts in (Extended)Markdown
** It should be possible to extend that for interactive stuff
* Notes directly from org-mode files
  e.g. for the berkeley sockets

* Semantic, human readable refs to articles, but also unique IDs
* Interactivity via including Purescript elements
* Automatic publishing
** Lives in 

   
* Tech

Probably hakyll, since that is Haskell, includes pandoc (markdown) and can do RSS
